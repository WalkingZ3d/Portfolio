The asynchronous function, seen between lines 20 and 29, makes a call to the GitHub API to update both the reposCount (number of repositories for that username) and ownerName (username) React States - and is called recursively on line 31. This method of nested async function is necessary as the useEffect itself cannot be asynchronous. ',

The async function, seen between lines 44 and 62, sets the number of pages required (lines 46 and 47) and calls the API to get as many repositories as each page will show.

Each one will navigate to the username/repositoryName upon click as the map allows for each link to use the title as a URL Parameter. RenderRepos() is called in the HTML return of this page. The 2 functions underneath (lines 90 - 105) handle the pagination controls of the Search page. Since the number of pages changes based on the user selection from a dropdown, these 2 functions use States to determine whether page navigation is possible or not. ',

On the Results page, the useParams() Hook (seen on line 9) is used to grab those pieces of data for later use. The useEffect(), shown between lines 14 and 25, is fired whenever the name changes - which is upon navigation to the page. The async function within then makes a call to the GitHub API to gather data about that paticular repository and add it to the empty object of RepoData seen on line 10.

Lines 10 - 15 are the nested routes required to allow the URL parameters to move to username/repositoryTitle and show the information to the user. Line 16 navigates the user to an about page where they can learn how to use the app. The final route on line 17 acts as a catch all to display a 404 page if the user tries to move to a URL that does not exist within the application.',
